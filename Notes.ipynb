    "`Pytorch` is a popular open-source Deep Learning Library developed by `Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR)`. In 2002, `Torch` was developed with `Lua` especially for performing `Tesnsor` based computations. In 2016, `Pytorch` was developed as a Python version of `Torch` and it has been widely used in the field of `Deep Learning` since then.\n",

    "`Pytorch` provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Graph** is a way to represent mathematical computations as a graph, where nodes represent operations and edges represent the flow of data. In `Pytorch`, the computational graph is dynamic, which means that it can be modified on-the-fly during runtime. This allows for more flexibility in building and training neural networks, as you can easily change the architecture or the operations being performed without having to redefine the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ONNX(Open Neural Network Exchange)** is an open format for representing machine learning models. It allows models to be transferred between different frameworks, such as `Pytorch`, `TensorFlow`, and `Caffe2`. This means that you can train a model in one framework and then export it to another framework for inference or deployment.+"
